This repository contains a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers.  The function includes robust error handling to gracefully manage the case of an empty input list, preventing ZeroDivisionError. The solution demonstrates a best practice by returning 0 when the list is empty rather than raising an exception.  This ensures that the function always returns a meaningful value.
